Explanation of Changes:
BaseLayout:

Passed the userId using Outlet's context prop to share userId with the Home component.
Home:

Used useOutletContext to access userId in Home and passed it to useUserData().
ToggleBtn:

onToggle was corrected to properly toggle between user 12 and 18, with state tracking.
Sidebar:

The onToggle prop is passed down to ToggleBtn, allowing user switching.
This approach should correctly toggle between users and fetch the corresponding data based on the selected user.
